# mlx-bun app

The runnable terminal app, server, and web surfaces live here. The first slice
provides model-management commands: `get`, `scan`, `ls`, `fit`, and `gc`.
Server and default web startup are still being migrated; running without a
command reports that limitation instead of silently doing something else.

`src/cli/main.ts` dispatches commands; `args.ts` owns accepted options and help;
`hub.ts` owns model-management presentation; `terminal.ts` owns formatting.
The CLI uses public library APIs. It does not own cache indexing, downloads,
fit calculations, model graphs, or numerical execution.

From the repository root, run `bun apps/mlx-bun/src/cli/main.ts --help`.
The [executable behavior examples](tests/hub-cli.test.ts) demonstrate scanning,
listing, fit estimates, and safe GC against a temporary synthetic cache with
native MLX blocked. Run them with `bun run --filter mlx-bun test`.
`bun scripts/verify-packages.ts --app-only` repeats those tests through an
installed package artifact, without building or loading native libraries.

`gc` previews changes unless `--yes` is supplied; `--dry-run` always prevents
deletion. Cache location and Hugging Face credentials follow the
[hub library](../../packages/hub/README.md). This workspace remains private
while app licensing and release packaging are decided.

## Web chat backend

`src/chat/protocol.ts` owns browser messages. `backend.ts` owns a per-server
WebSocket lifecycle behind the `ChatBackend` interface and a send-frame callback.
The Pi implementation in `pi-backend.ts` calls the application's loopback HTTP
API; it imports no server, engine, or native numerical implementation.
`history.ts`, `events.ts`, and `policy.ts` own transcript operations, event
translation, and chat policy; the tool modules own app navigation, web retrieval,
and durable approval choices. Pi dependencies stay in this app workspace.

Composition supplies the backend factory to `makeChatWebSocketHandler`, mounts
its `websocket` handler, and awaits its `dispose()` on shutdown. Each connection
gets an independent agent session. Abort and approval messages remain available
while a prompt is running. The [lifecycle examples](tests/chat-backend.test.ts)
exercise startup failure, disconnects, cancellation, and shutdown without a
server or native libraries; [chat behavior tests](tests/chat-policy.test.ts)
cover history, sampling scopes, thinking events, tool-loop policy, and UI tools.

Memory is disabled until its app owner supplies tool definitions, names, skill
paths, and its prompt hint through `PiBackendOptions.memory`. Download context
is an optional callback from app composition. Browser assets and HTTP/WebSocket
route wiring remain separate migration work. Standalone Pi integration remains
deferred. The protocol exposes no serial-serving lane selection.

## Browser app

`src/web/browser/` preserves the existing chat, model, training, quantization,
dataset, memory, and status UI. Browser code imports only local browser modules
and the data-only chat/job protocols. Unported backend features may return 501
during migration; preserving their UI does not claim their backend is ready.

`src/web/assets.ts` provides `createWebHandler()`, which loads the static payloads
and returns a `Request → Response | null` handler for application composition.
It opens no listener. `bun run --filter mlx-bun build:web` creates ignored
`dist/web/app.js`; prepack generates and includes that file, so installed apps
need no build step. Static HTML, theme, manifest, worker, and icon live in
`src/web/public/`. The vendored highlight.js bundle retains its BSD license in
`public/vendor/hljs-LICENSE`; its existing header records upstream provenance.

[Browser behavior tests](tests/web/browser.test.ts) cover streaming rendering,
escaping, attachments, panels, and interactions without a live server.
[Static tests](tests/web/assets.test.ts) exercise the built bundle and asset
headers. The packed consumer check verifies the same assets after installation.
