# mlx-bun app

The runnable terminal app, server, and web surfaces live here. The first slice
provides model-management commands: `get`, `scan`, `ls`, `fit`, and `gc`.
Server and default web startup are still being migrated; running without a
command reports that limitation instead of silently doing something else.

`src/cli/main.ts` dispatches commands; `args.ts` owns accepted options and help;
`hub.ts` owns model-management presentation; `terminal.ts` owns formatting.
The CLI uses public library APIs. It does not own cache indexing, downloads,
fit calculations, model graphs, or numerical execution.

From the repository root, run `bun apps/mlx-bun/src/cli/main.ts --help`.
The [executable behavior examples](tests/hub-cli.test.ts) demonstrate scanning,
listing, fit estimates, and safe GC against a temporary synthetic cache with
native MLX blocked. Run them with `bun run --filter mlx-bun test`.
`bun scripts/verify-packages.ts --app-only` repeats those tests through an
installed package artifact, without building or loading native libraries.

`gc` previews changes unless `--yes` is supplied; `--dry-run` always prevents
deletion. Cache location and Hugging Face credentials follow the
[hub library](../../packages/hub/README.md). This workspace remains private
while app licensing and release packaging are decided.

`src/engine/` owns loaded model lifetimes, preparation admission and the shared
continuous scheduler. `createAppEngine` takes ownership of its model context;
closing drains execution before releasing compiled runners, adapters, drafts,
model constants and weights. Replacement models can provide their own binding.
HTTP parsing, response formatting and web policy belong above this boundary.

[Engine behavior tests](tests/engine/model-host.test.ts) verify injected model
loading and lifecycle without native MLX. The gateway and session tests beside
it cover cancellation, output delivery and the same scheduler path at capacity
one and greater. These are CPU checks, not real-weight numerical verification.
The first engine slice reports unsupported shared-execution capabilities rather
than running a hidden serial path. The library's denoising method still needs
shared scheduler support before the app can serve diffusion models.
