# STATUS — live handoff

The single "what's the state, what's next" doc. Durable phase history,
exit criteria, and findings live in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md); superseded session
summaries move to [PLAN-archive.md](PLAN-archive.md). Product/UX north star:
[docs/planning/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md](docs/planning/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md).

**Fidelity tiers (the governing contract):** **L1** = mlx-lm bit-exact parity ·
**L2** = mlx-optiq bit-exact parity · **L3** = original optimizations beyond both,
gated by math checks + KL/quality (not bit-exactness).

**Current release: v0.0.8** (2026-06-24) — npm + Homebrew + GitHub. Everything
below the DiffusionGemma port (the Dreaming, DSpark, this cleanup) is **unreleased**;
consider cutting v0.0.9 once the compat work lands.

## Multi-agent review + cleanup (2026-07-01) — verified state, open decisions

Two adversarially-verified review workflows (13 agents) swept the whole repo; the
full report is local at `reports/project-review-2026-07-01.md` (gitignored). What
landed the same day: repo hygiene sweep (scratch logs/example.ts/pycache/runs
untracked; megakernel → `scripts/experiments/`; orphan worktree removed;
`fix/section-synthesis` third-person-voice fix **merged**), docs truth pass (this
file rewritten; flash-attn story reconciled; README/CLAUDE.md doc map refreshed).

**Confirmed findings, still open (ranked):**
1. **ORPO L_SFT scope divergence** — our SFT/NLL term is **response-only**
   (`src/train/loss.ts:1225` via `branchLogpMean*`); the paper (arXiv 2403.07691),
   TRL's ORPOTrainer, and xfactlab/orpo all compute it over the **full
   prompt+response** (only padding masked). Everything else in the ORPO stack
   (odds-ratio math, signs, λ, normalization, fused-head backward, prefix-share
   gradients, data path) verified correct against primary sources. **DECISION
   (Josh): match the reference (add prompt tokens to the NLL term / a
   `sft-scope` option) or keep response-only deliberately.** Until then,
   parity claims vs TRL/paper ORPO are not apples-to-apples.
2. **DSpark τ=3.24 is a teacher-forced proxy** — `evalTau` feeds the Markov head
   ground-truth previous tokens; live decode threads the drafter's own drafts.
   Run `scripts/dspark-measure-dflash.ts` (live τ via `meanAcceptLen`) on the
   overfit checkpoint before the 27B retarget. Architecture itself verified
   faithful (see DSpark section).
3. **Memory batching default** — `src/memory/model.ts:164` defaults
   `MLX_BUN_MEMORY_BATCH` to **8**, but batching measured 1.7–1.9× SLOWER for the
   real extract/chunk workload; docs recommend serial. Flip the default to 1.
4. **No CI** — the only GitHub workflow deploys the website; nothing runs
   `bunx tsc --noEmit` or `bun test` on push. Add a gate.
5. **Test gaps** — DPO has zero loss/e2e tests; ORPO fused-CE tests assert only
   "loss decreases" (real grad-parity checks live un-wired in
   `scripts/experiments/`); DSpark smoke tests live outside `tests/`.
6. **`mlx-bun memory status`** prints "synthesis stubbed (M1)" — false; synthesis
   ships. Fix the status text.

**In progress (Josh directive 2026-07-01):** CLI flags/defaults parity with
`mlx_lm.server` + implement all missing mlx-lm functionality. Known gaps
(verified vs the oracle venv): no `/v1/completions`, no `/health`, no
logprobs/min_p/xtc/penalties/logit_bias/role_mapping; port 8090 vs 8080; host
binds all interfaces vs mlx-lm's loopback; `--decode-concurrency` alias has
different semantics; no `--temp` alias; `/v1/models` lists only the served model;
CLI verbs convert/fuse/cache_prompt/evaluate/perplexity/upload/awq/dwq/gptq absent.

## THE DREAMING (local personal-wiki memory) — ACTIVE. Handoff: [docs/design/the-dreaming-handoff.md](docs/design/the-dreaming-handoff.md)

Conversations → chunks → entities → **subject articles** → cross-linked,
self-healing wiki, all local (`src/memory/`). **Works end-to-end on real data.**
Staged, chronological, resumable pipeline (`stages.ts`): segment (our
e4b-chunk-300 chunker) → extract → route (surface-EVERYTHING) → create/patch
(self-healing, date-aware, `## History`) → reconcile → link (18%→96% See-also,
22.7× edges) → wikify. Reference: [docs/reference/memory.md](docs/reference/memory.md).

- **Inference-path rework LANDED** (`src/memory/model.ts`): the in-process
  gateway design from [docs/design/memory-inference-path.md](docs/design/memory-inference-path.md) —
  ONE shared TaskModel + mounted chunk adapter + BatchScheduler,
  `callLocal`/`callLocalBatch`, template fix ({system,user}) included. (The old
  "wire through a persistent HTTP server" framing is obsolete — the design doc
  chose in-process.) Known issue: batch default 8 vs measured-better serial (open
  finding #3 above).
- **Third-person voice + Wikipedia carve-outs fix merged** (was stranded on
  `fix/section-synthesis`; merged 2026-07-01).
- **Full-corpus import PAUSED at cursor 900/2096 (~43%)** (677+ articles in
  `~/.mlx-bun/wiki-full`); resumable via
  `bun scripts/experiments/dreaming-full-run.ts`. NOTE: the wiki-full git tree
  has ~11 uncommitted mid-batch article edits from the 2026-06-29 interruption —
  review/commit or reset before resuming. Real vault `~/.mlx-bun/wiki` untouched.
- **Standing rules:** notability = "recurs in your thinking" (no ownership gate);
  subject-based articles; chronological; cross-linking is WIKIFY's job; prompts
  SCHEMATIC; Lucien = read-only oracle; quality judged by CLOUD JUDGE, never bucket-F1.
- **Next:** flip batch default → resume import (~50h serial) → reindex +
  `memory link` → judge a broad sample → promote to the real vault + nightly fold-in.

## DSpark speculative drafter — faithful build done; architecture verified 2026-07-01. Handoff: [docs/investigations/dspark-handoff.md](docs/investigations/dspark-handoff.md) · Design: [docs/design/dspark-speculative-decoding.md](docs/design/dspark-speculative-decoding.md)

Faithful DSpark = DFlash multi-layer KV injection (Eq 2–3) + Markov head +
confidence head, `src/spec/dspark/*-dflash.ts` (v1 `*.ts` kept as superseded
baseline). The 2026-07-01 adversarial review verified the implementation faithful
end-to-end: Eq 2–3 injection, masks, heads, position embeddings, the p^t/TV
off-by-one fix, no target leakage, and the sliding-window `trim(n,bypass)`
rollback all confirmed correct. Repo typechecks 0; CPU smokes 16/16 + 33/33.
- **Caveat (review finding #2):** the overfit proof (per-pos ~0.75, τ 3.24) is a
  **teacher-forced analytic proxy** — measure live τ with
  `scripts/dspark-measure-dflash.ts` before trusting it for the decode loop.
- **Two gaps to a real speedup (not architecture):** (1) DATA — 160 articles
  generalize to per-pos ~0.17 (paper uses 1.3M×10). (2) TARGET SPEED — e4b
  (45.9 tok/s) is ~worst-case for the fixed draft overhead; the **27B agentic
  workload is the real target** (τ≈3 could net ~2–3×).
- Not wired into serve/CLI (research-only); smoke tests live in `scripts/` not
  `tests/` (review finding #5). Minor: v1 loader lacks a checkpoint-variant guard.
- **Next:** live-τ measurement → retarget 27B/12b (regen+train; 27B/32GB is
  memory-tight) → scale data → tighten draft loop → RNN head + STS + Alg-1
  scheduler → rename dflash→dspark.

## ORPO / training stack — shipped in v0.0.5+; open items

The full stack (flash-CCE steel head fwd+bwd, segmented backward, prefix-sharing,
`mlx-bun train` CLI, warm-start, adapters-in-cache) is live — details in
[docs/reference/training.md](docs/reference/training.md) +
[docs/reference/orpo-quickstart.md](docs/reference/orpo-quickstart.md) +
[docs/investigations/steel-flash-cce-handoff.md](docs/investigations/steel-flash-cce-handoff.md).
- **Open decision:** L_SFT scope (review finding #1 above).
- **The chunk segmenter** (THE load-bearing run): distill Opus/GPT-5.5
  segmentation into a local model; scored by boundary/label accuracy vs gold
  (chunk-eval), NOT val loss.
- **CPM5 UltraFeedback dress-rehearsal** PAUSED ~step 4820 (val 1.66→~1.50
  plateau; checkpoints in `./adapters/cpm5-uf-8h/checkpoints/`, best ~step-04200);
  resumable via `RESUME=<ckpt>`. Long runs MUST be launched from Josh's own shell
  (`nohup … &`) — agent-spawned runs get reaped (~47 min).
- **The e4b overnight** — `scripts/train-orpo.ts` full stack at 8192 (Josh runs it).
- Flash-attn kernel status (reconciled 2026-07-01): port bugs fixed +
  FD-validated at T≤256; e4b ≥2K re-validation pending; ~30× slower — default
  `ops.sdpa` remains the path.
- Test gaps: DPO untested; grad-parity scripts un-wired (review finding #5).

## Batched serving (Phase 18) — engine live; polish open

`--batch N` continuous batching is live for full-attention (CPM) AND
sliding-window (Gemma), bit-parity with mlx-lm B=N; scheduler + gateway wired
into the server. Full history in PLAN.md Phase 18 / PLAN-archive; design:
[docs/design/parallel-slots.md](docs/design/parallel-slots.md).
Remaining polish (all optional): `extend` join op (today a join re-merges,
O(B·S)), prompt-cache reuse under batching, `B×S_max` KV-budget admission,
clean-machine throughput numbers (Josh-gated). L2 (quantized-KV batched) and L3
(perf kernels under batching) are later rows — batched + mixed-precision KV is a
novel extension (no oracle), KL-gated, deferred.

## Open / Josh-gated

These need Josh physically (hardware, downloads, reboots):

1. **Clean-machine `./benchmark.sh --redo`** after a reboot (+ `sudo purge`) —
   quotable rows; promote into `benchmarks/RESULTS.md`. Also gates the
   `MLX_BUN_PERF_KERNEL` default flip and DiffusionGemma D4 perf numbers.
2. **M1 Max rerun** — `git pull` then `./benchmark.sh --redo`.
3. **Phase 14 — Qwen3.6-27B confirmation** (~15 GB download):
   `bun scripts/regen-qwen-parity-goldens.ts 27b` then
   `MLX_BUN_TEST_QWEN35=1 bun test tests/qwen-parity.test.ts`. 4B both bars green.
4. **Phase 13 — TurboQuant** (promoted research direction).
5. **Vision remainder** — audio tower + 26B/31B SigLIP (e4b + 12B live).
6. **The e4b ORPO overnight** + resuming the CPM5 UF run (own-shell `nohup`).

## Recently completed (pointers, not state)

- **DiffusionGemma-26B-A4B-it port — COMPLETE** (D1 bit-exact forward, D2
  token-for-token denoising, D3 text+image serving, D5 diffusion-LoRA; D4 perf is
  Josh-gated bench). Dossier: [docs/design/diffusion-gemma-port.md](docs/design/diffusion-gemma-port.md).
